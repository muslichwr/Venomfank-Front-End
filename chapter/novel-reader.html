                    The Great Tomb of Nazarick stood silently in the darkness, its imposing presence casting long shadows across the desolate landscape. Within its hallowed halls, the Supreme Being known as Ainz Ooal Gown contemplated the events that had led to this moment.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It had been months since the establishment of the Sorcerer Kingdom, and the undead overlord had grown accustomed to the responsibilities that came with ruling a nation. Yet, despite all his power and the loyalty of his guardians, there were still mysteries that eluded even his vast intelligence.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Albedo," Ainz called out, his voice echoing through the throne room. The succubus guardian appeared instantly, her wings folding gracefully as she bowed deeply before her master.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Yes, Ainz-sama?" she replied, her golden eyes gleaming with devoted attention.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Tell me, what news do we have from the northern territories? I sense disturbances in the magical currents that flow through our domain." The skeletal figure leaned forward slightly, his red orbs glowing with interest.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Albedo straightened, her expression becoming serious. "My lord, our scouts have reported unusual magical phenomena in the region. It appears that an ancient seal has been weakened, possibly broken. The implications could be... significant."
                </p>

                <p>
                    This revelation intrigued Ainz greatly. In his previous life as a salaryman, he had always been drawn to mysteries and puzzles. Now, as an undead overlord with immense magical power, such enigmas presented both opportunity and potential threat.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Gather the Floor Guardians," he commanded, his voice carrying the weight of absolute authority. "We shall investigate this matter personally. If there are forces at work that could threaten Nazarick, we must act swiftly and decisively."
                </p>

                <p>
                    As Albedo departed to carry out his orders, Ainz remained seated on his throne, deep in thought. The world of the New World continued to surprise him with its complexities and hidden depths. Each day brought new challenges that required careful consideration and strategic planning.
                </p>

                <p>
                    He remembered his guildmates from YGGDRASIL, wondering what they would make of his current situation. Would they approve of the path he had chosen? Would they understand the necessity of the actions he had taken to protect what remained of their shared creation?
                </p>

                <p>
                    The weight of leadership pressed down upon him, heavier than any armor he had ever worn. Yet, he would not falter. For the sake of Nazarick, for the memory of Ainz Ooal Gown, he would see this through to whatever end awaited them all.
                </p>

                <h3>A New Discovery</h3>

                <p>
                    Hours later, the Floor Guardians assembled in the Throne Room. Shalltear, Cocytus, Aura, Mare, Demiurge, and Albedo stood in a semicircle before their lord, each with their unique powers and intellect ready to be deployed at his command.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "My loyal Guardians," Ainz began, his voice resonating through the vast chamber. "I have called you here because we face a new situation that requires our attention. Albedo, please share what our scouts have discovered."
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Guardian Overseer stepped forward, her black wings folded neatly behind her. "Yes, Ainz-sama. Our intelligence reports indicate that approximately three days ago, an unusual magical disturbance occurred in the mountain range north of the Azerlisia Mountains. The disturbance appears to have originated from an ancient structure that was previously undetected by our surveillance."
                </p>

                <p>
                    She gestured, and a magical projection appeared in the air, displaying a stone structure partially embedded in the side of a mountain. Runes of unknown origin covered its surface, glowing with a faint blue light.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "This structure," she continued, "predates any known civilization in this world according to our records. The runes do not match any known language, not even those from YGGDRASIL."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Demiurge, ever analytical, adjusted his glasses. "Fascinating. A civilization that predates even the game knowledge? This could provide valuable insights into this world's true nature."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Cocytus's mandibles clicked thoughtfully. "Could. This. Be. A. Threat. To. Nazarick?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    "That remains to be determined," Ainz replied, his skeletal hand gripping the staff of Ainz Ooal Gown. "Which is why we must investigate personally. I will lead this expedition, accompanied by Aura, Mare, and Shalltear. The rest of you will maintain vigilance over Nazarick in our absence."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "But Ainz-sama," Albedo protested, concern evident in her voice. "Allowing you to venture forth without maximum protection—"
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ainz raised a hand, silencing her. "Your concern is noted, Albedo. However, this mission requires stealth and reconnaissance rather than overwhelming force. Besides," he added with a hint of amusement in his voice, "I am quite capable of protecting myself."
